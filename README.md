## Description

this project was the creation of a note taker app that specifically utilized Express.js on the back end to save and retrieve data from JSON files (Link to live website). The application utilized router.get, router.put, and router.delete to retrieve and render added notes on the front end. The application utilizes starter code as the front end.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input <br>
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information<br>
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input<br>
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML<br>
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address<br>
WHEN I click on the GitHub username<br>
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab<br>
WHEN I start the application<br>
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br>
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number<br>
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building
my team<br>
WHEN I select the engineer option<br>
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back
to the menu<br>
WHEN I select the intern option<br>
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu<br>
WHEN I decide to finish building my team<br>
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated<br>
